  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our extension allows users to capture chart snippets from web pages and generate AI insights.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected data:</strong> None. We do not track browsing history or personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>User-generated data:</strong> Captured chart images and AI-generated insights derived from them.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Captured images are sent to our AI API to generate insights. Insights are displayed within the extension and stored locally in your browser. Data is not shared with third parties, except the AI API used for processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Charts and summaries are stored locally in your browser using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>. Data remains unless you reset or remove it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The extension uses an AI service hosted at <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">https://render.com/</a> to process chart images. Only selected charts are sent.</p>
	<p>data sent through the API is not used to train or improve their models. This is to protect enterprise and developer privacy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>You can reset all data at any time using the “Reset” button in the extension or uninstall the extension, which deletes all stored data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>Reasonable measures are taken to protect your data while processed and stored locally. No sensitive personal information is collected.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. GenAI Content</h2>
    <p>The content provided by “AI Chart Intelligence Tool” is generated by artificial intelligence and may not always accurately reflect the intent of the visual. While we strive to offer reliable and helpful insights, the AI-generated output should be independently verified before any actions are taken based on it.</p>
  </section>

  
  <section>
    <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Updated versions will be posted online and reflected in the extension description.</p>
